### Tasks

# NOTE: The original idea was taken from [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding) from his series of videos about 3d software rendering game (https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily)

This utility allows you to create, delete or close tasks for projects directly in the project folder

Quick start:
Since the utility is written in the Odin programming language, you need to [download](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) a compiler for this language
After this, you can compile and install the utility:
```console
sudo make build install
```
